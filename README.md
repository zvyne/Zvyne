# ZVYNE

Welcome to ZVYNE, the personal space of Zain Gonsalves.  
Here I explore human rights, psychology, and behaviour through blogs, reflections, and poetry.  

This website is live, interactive, and fully editable by me—the admin. Each post is designed to be human, poetic, and thought-provoking.
